        </choices>
    <answer>B</answer>
    <exp>The tracing was ventricular fibrillation and the therapy was necessary and appropriate.
    There were some VF beats that were not sensed. All undersensed beats were small in amplitude and occurred after a beat with a much larger amplitude.
    Lead noise should not be seen in far-field EGM. Also, in the near-field EGM of a lead noise case, the amplitude will likely be high and saturate the channel.
    Noted with some definitions: Inappropriate therapy = therapy for non-VT/VF; Unnecessary therapy = therapy for VT/VF that could have been avoided.

        <e>A single-coil lead is associated with lower complication during the extraction.</e>

    <answer>E</answer>
    <exp>Because of the abundance of data showing no benefit of dual-coil over single-coil leads and a higher associated complication rate during lead extraction, Single-coil leads should be regarded as the standard of care for icds. 
    Dual-coil leads might be considered in populations in which the dft threshold might be higher and/or when dft safety margin fails with a single-coil lead.

    <answer>A</answer>
    <exp>An RCT of patients without bradycardia pacing indication showed no difference in the incidence of inappropriate shock between dual-chamber and single-chamber ICD.
    A dual-chamber is always associated with a more complications during implantation and a more battery consumption than a single-chamber device.
    Dual-chamber ICD should be considered over single-chamber ICD in patients with sinus node dysfunction or AV block with preserved LV function.

        </choices>
    <answer>C</answer>
    <exp>The recordings show a consistently spaced interval between two signals with the initial signal lower amplitude than the second signal.
    This suggests an INTEGRATED BIPOLAR LEAD with atrial sensing; the newly implanted ICD lead is probably too shallow in the RV. This problem cannot be overcome by programming changes.
    If left uncorrected, oversensing atrial signal could potentially lead to inappropriate therapy.

<!--noncapture-->
<question>
    <index>Non-capture</index>
    <clinical>A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a syncopal event. He was eating dinner and was witnessed to abruptly fall back in his chair for several seconds before regaining consciousness. His past history includes atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He tells you that 15 years ago, he received a pacemaker because “his heart stopped.” A generator change was performed 5 years ago. He has regular pacemaker checks; the last one was 3 months ago, and he was told everything was fine. His medications include warfarin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
        
        On examination, his blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg with a heart rate of 75 bpm. The physical examination is unremarkable. A pacemaker programmer is available to you if needed. As you speak to him, his eyes roll back and a telemetry strip is recorded (as shown).
    </clinical>

    <mainQ>
        Which of the following should be your next step in management of this patient?

    <choices>
        <a>Increase the ventricular sensitivity of the pacemaker.</a>
        <b>Place a magnet over the device.</b>
        <c>Initiate external pacing with cutaneous patches.</c>
        <d>Place a temporary pacemaker.</d>
        <e>Increase the ventricular output of the pacemaker.</e>
        </choices>
    <answer>E
        </answer>
    <exp>Tracing = loss of ventricular capture in an underlying rhythm of complete heart block. 
        Pacing lead is 15 years old so lead problem is highly possible. 
        Interrogation will reveal and temporary fix the cause if it is readily available as in this case. 
        There is no issue of inappropriate sensing so magnet or adjusting sensitivity would not help.

        </mainQ>
    <choices>
        <a>To prevent the ventricular sensing amplifier from sensing the far-field P wave.</a>
        <b>To limit the maximal atrial rate which ventricular pacing can track.</b>

        <e>To prevent inhibition of ventricular pacing by electromechanical interference.</e>
        </choices>
    <answer>D</answer>
    <exp>The purpose of any refractory periods is to prevent the pacemaker for responding to inappropriate signals.
    PVARP is an atrial refractory period that occurs after a paced or sensed ventricular event. PVARP prevents the atrial channel from sensing the ventricular pacing pulse, the far-field QRS and retrograde P-waves.

    <exp>A was not sensing properly due to the dislodgement. A pace occurred slightly before the QRS. QRS then fell within the safety pacing zone.

    Ventricular Safety Pacing functions to prevent ventricular asystole due to inappropriate inhibition of ventricular pacing. Such inhibition may be caused by crosstalk or ventricular oversensing. By triggering ventricular pacing after an oversensed ventricular event, the device maintains its ability to provide full ventricular support.
    After an atrial paced event, the device begins a 110 ms safety pacing interval. Any ventricular sensed event that occurs within the 110 millisecond window will result in a ventricular pace at the end of the 110 millisecond window. Atrial sensed (AS) events do not initiate a Ventricular Safety Pacing interval.

    At the 3rd beat, there is an atrial pacing with A capture. No evidence of ventricular pacing following that beat is observed. V oversensing is likely the problem. When oversensing occurs only after the atrial pacing, oversensing the atrial signal or cross talk is the culprit.
    The initial solutions would be reducing the atrial output or lowering the ventricular sensitivity or increasing the PAVB or turn on the safety pacing if available. If the programmer is unavailable, magnet application could be used temporarily.

After 2 drop beats (AP without VS), the pacemaker switched to AP-VP. This is the typical characteristic of the algorithm to reduce unnecessary ventricular pacing by means of mode switching between AAI and DDD.
    This patient now likely develops AV nodal disease in addition to sinus node disease. The AAI/DDD mode is not appropriate at this stage as a drop beat could trigger a long-short sequence and ventricular arrhythmia.

    <answer>A</answer>
    <exp>Congenital complete AV block occurs in 1 of 14,000-20,000 live births and is thought to be the result of transplacental passage of autoantibodies against Ro and La intracellular ribonuclear proteins from the mother who may have a clinical autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjögren syndrome. These patients may be completely asymptomatic throughout childhood and adolescence and require no active cardiology intervention, but there are certain findings that require intervention regardless of symptoms. According to the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 Guidelines, permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for congenital third-degree AV block with a wide QRS escape rhythm, mean day-time heart rate below 50bpm, complex ventricular ectopy, or ventricular dysfunction (Class I, Level of Evidence B).
    This is independent of the presence of symptoms because a wide complex escape rhythm may be unreliable and result in abrupt pauses that may result in cardiac arrest. Ventricular dysfunction is not common and when present is best treated with pacemaker implantation. Although ACE inhibition may be used in combination with device therapy, its use is contraindicated in a young woman of child-bearing age. There is no indication for an electrophysiology study in patients with congenital complete AV block. There is no role for amiodarone, especially because it may slow the underlying junctional escape rhythm. Pacemaker therapy might result in an improvement in her LV function.

    <exp>The ECG is consistent with sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block. The differential is Mobitz type I second-degree AV block versus Mobitz type II second-degree AV block. Noninvasive vagal and sympathetic maneuvers can help to distinguish one from the other, since Mobitz I block is usually AV nodal, and Mobitz II block is usually in the His-Purkinje system. In a patient with AV nodal block, carotid sinus massage will slow the sinus rate and worsen AV conduction, which will worsen the AV block. The slowing of sinus rate and depression of AV conduction will have a protective effect on the distal conduction system, so conduction in the His-Purkinje may improve. Exercise (sympathetic stimulation) will improve AV nodal conduction, and worsen His-Purkinje conduction. His ECG (Figure 1) is suggestive of Mobitz I second-degree block, based on the long PR interval and narrow QRS interval.
